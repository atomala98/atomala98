Hi, Iâ€™m Andrzej Tomala

I'm mostly interested in Python development/backend technologies (Django), 
but I have also some experience with C++ (mostly JUCE framework) and working with microcontrollers (Arduino/ESP32).

Through my Acoustic Engineering studies, I was able to participate in many projects and handle some of them by myself. 
Here is the list of the most interesting projects I worked on alone.

# Backend projects

## App for audio codec testing

https://github.com/atomala98/sound-test-app

A project that I'm currently working on, as a master thesis. The Django-based app, focused on performing codec quality tests, aggregating data
about results (examined person age, gender, and answers in several tests), and exporting data in CSV/creating PDF reports. All exams can be planned
by a scientist, based on ITU P.800, ITU BS.1534-3, and ITU BS.1116-2 standards (e.g. MUSHRA test).

## App for ambisonic to mono conversion

https://github.com/atomala98/Ambisonic-To-Mono

A kind of joke based on all YT-to-mp3-converters. A small app written in FastApi and JS, enables a user to convert his ambisonic AMBIX/FUMA recording to a
mono track, or coincidental stereo pair (e.g. XY).

## Basic to-do app

https://github.com/atomala98/todoList

Basic app created in Flask. Have some additional features like an e-mail with an account activation link and allaining tasks for groups of users.

# Other Python projects

## Brainfuck IDE

https://github.com/atomala98/brainfuck-IDE

Brainfuck programming language interpreter with IDE written in Python (Tkinter). Have some basic features like saving files and
loading them. Also have a code backlight added.

## Space invaders

https://github.com/atomala98/SpaceInvaders

At the end of 2020, I created some basic games like Snake, Minesweeper, and Hangman, using the PyGame module. Here is an example of my programming skills 
two years ago. Pretty basic game - you shot and dodge shots. Still, was great fun implementing.

# Non-python projects

## ESP32 synth

https://github.com/atomala98/esp32-synth

My thesis for finishing engineering studies. This synthesizer is implemented in pure C, without using any synth library (only for touch screen connection).
Everything is based on a digital to analog converter (DAC) implemented in ESP32. Really fun project, mostly about understanding how digital sound is 
working on an "every sample" level. Have also had some features like AM/FM modulation, ASR envelope, and arpeggiator.

## InputSynthName synthesiser

Synthesiser was created for one of my last year's classes. Created in C++ with the JUCE framework, really shows the basis of granular synthesis. Gives the user chance to choose 
a sample that should be cut to grains and other parameters like grain could size, grain length, and grain volume. Outputs pretty randomized sound, but well
- that's what we love in a granular synth.

## Delay3000

A smaller project, created mostly for learning JUCE. While not the best implementation of the delay effect, it's still working fine and can be used in 
real-life music production.

# Smaller "projects"

## Hard coder challenge

https://github.com/atomala98/hard-coder-challenge

10-day programming challenge I attended, with some interesting tasks to do daily - from e-mail sending automats, through sending requests, to 
some work on the database. 

## Leetcode

https://leetcode.com/user2071sI/ <- my leetcode profile

Last year I found solving algorithmic problems, just like solving sudokus or crosswords. Throughout year I solved over 200 puzzles and I'm still looking
forward to doing some more in my free time.
